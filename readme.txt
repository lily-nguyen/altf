This is a plugin to highlight occurrences of a selected text.

For adding the plugin into Eclipse:
- copy the .jar file to dropin folder in Eclipse
- restart Eclipse

For using:
- select a text in a file 
- press Alt+F, all positions of text will be marked
- to remove the highlights, select nothing and press Alt+F again.


Hope that can help!
